# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-with-N
Monte Carlo Simulation with N using C

## Task:
Imagine you have N boxes numbered 1-N. You start with N chips. You distribute the N chips randomly into the boxes using a random number generator. That is, you pick a number from 1-N from a uniform distribution with replacement and place a chip into the box with the corresponding random number. You keep picking random numbers until all the chips are exhausted. When the chips are exhausted some of the boxes will be empty, some of the boxes will have one chip, and some of the boxes will have multiple chips.
The purpose of this revised simulation is to find out how the expected proportion of empty boxes behaves as N grows large.
You are to run a Monte Carlo simulation of the experiment. Run your experiment with different numbers of boxes. See how many boxes are practical. Run your simulation with enough trials to make your results meaningful. 
Remember the purpose of this revised simulation is to find out how the expected proportion of empty boxes behaves as N grows large. That is what we want to know.

## Output: 
N = 1, Expected Proportion of Empty Boxes: 0.0000 </br>
N = 100, Expected Proportion of Empty Boxes: 0.3661 </br>
N = 500, Expected Proportion of Empty Boxes: 0.3676 </br>
N = 1000, Expected Proportion of Empty Boxes: 0.3677 </br>
N = 1500, Expected Proportion of Empty Boxes: 0.3678 </br>
N = 2000, Expected Proportion of Empty Boxes: 0.3678 </br>
N = 2500, Expected Proportion of Empty Boxes: 0.3678 </br>
N = 3000, Expected Proportion of Empty Boxes: 0.3678 </br>
